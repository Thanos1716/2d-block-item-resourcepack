###### Flatten your Minecraft blocks

Replace all of those 3D inventory previews with drawn textures! Make your inventories consistent! Or just use a neat-looking pack.

Features
--------

- Mostly high-quality textures!
- The death of the third dimension*!
- Differentiation between otherwise identical blocks, like a shiny finish on the waxed copper items!
- Neat animations!
- A more cohesive visual style!

<sup><sup>\*Death of the third dimension only available in the GUI and your hand.</sup></sup>
